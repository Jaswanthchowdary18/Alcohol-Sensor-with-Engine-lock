# Alcohol-Sensor-with-Engine-lock

The objective is to improve road safety by detecting alcohol levels in a driver’s breath using a sensor. If alcohol is detected above a certain threshold, the engine remains locked, preventing the vehicle from starting.
When the driver breathes near the MQ-3 sensor, it detects alcohol concentration. If it’s above the safe limit, the Arduino triggers the relay module to keep the engine off and activates a buzzer or LED to alert. If no alcohol is detected, the engine is allowed to start.
